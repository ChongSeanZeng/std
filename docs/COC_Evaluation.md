# PART I:  General Requirements
## 1	General principles
1\.1	A chain of custody certificate issued by an FSC-accredited certification body provides a credible guarantee that all chain of custody operations within the scope of a certificate conform to all applicable requirements of the relevant FSC normative documents. In order to provide such a guarantee, the certification body shall:

a)	analyse and describe the chain of custody operation and/or group or multisite certificate to be evaluated in terms of one or more operational sites;

b)	confirm that there is a control system in place capable of ensuring that all the applicable requirements are implemented by every operational site, including non-certified suppliers as part of controlled wood and reclaimed-material verification programs, project members in the case of project certificates and contractors as part of outsourcing agreements, within the scope of the evaluation;

c)	where applicable, carry out sampling of operational sites , non-certified suppliers , contractors, project sites, non-FSC-certified project members, documents, management records, and interviews with personnel sufficient to verify that the control system is being implemented effectively and consistently across the whole scope of the certificate; 

d)	confirm that any nonconformity is adequately addressed by the organization within the established timelines.

NOTE: The timeline starts when the corrective action request is formally accepted by, or formally presented to, the organization (whichever occurs first).

NOTE: The chain of custody requirements of the FSC normative framework are designed to be applied at the site level of a chain of custody operation, unless otherwise specified in a standard.
## 2	Evaluation requirements
2\.1	The certification body shall complete an analysis and description of the operational sites included in the scope of the evaluation, as well as the structures and systems in place for their management.

NOTE: The results of this analysis and description are required as the basis for subsequent evaluation of the management structure and for sampling the operational sites included in the scope of the evaluation.

2\.2	The certification body shall define the scope of the chain of custody evaluation by the following parameters:

a)	organizations certified according to FSC-STD-40-004: site(s), product group(s), processes or activities performed by the organization (including participating sites of multisite or group certificates and contractors) and applicable FSC normative document(s) against which these processes or activities are audited.

b)	organizations certified according to FSC-STD-40-006: projects, participating sites, project members, specification of the scope as one-time or continuous certification, processes or activities performed by the organization and project members and applicable FSC normative document(s) against which these processes or activities are audited.

2\.3	The certification body shall determine, in accordance with its documented procedures, the auditing time needed to accomplish each evaluation of the organization’s chain of custody control system, covering the requirements that are applicable to the scope of the certificate. 

**Evaluation of management systems**

2\.4	The certification body shall complete an analysis of the organization’s management control required to ensure that all applicable certification requirements are implemented over the full range of chain of custody operations, including the identification and analysis of the critical control points.

NOTE: In the case of large multisite organisations the requirement to evaluate conformity implies the need to evaluate management systems and their functioning at regional and sub-regional offices.

2\.5	The certification body shall evaluate the capacity of the organization to implement its management system consistently and effectively as described. This evaluation shall include consideration of:

a)	the technical and material resources available (e.g. system and technology for FSC-certified production control, segregation of materials);

b)	the human resources available (e.g. the number of people involved in management, their training and experience; the availability of expert advice, if required);

c)	for group and multi-site certificates, the complexity and scale of the activities covered by the certificate scope. This information will be used to evaluate the central office’s ability to manage the number of participating sites within the scope of the certificate and determine its annual growth limits.

NOTE: The certification body may make use of information that is available as a result of previous evaluations in relation to FSC normative documents and/or in relation to other standards such as those published by ISO. In all cases, the certification body shall make its own independent decision as to whether or not the organization conforms to the applicable certification requirements.

**Evaluation at the level of the operational site**

2\.6	The certification body shall evaluate each operational site within the scope of the evaluation (including a sample of participating sites of group and multisite certificates and non-FSC-certified project members in the case of project certificates) in order to make direct, factual observations to verify the organization’s conformance to all applicable certification requirements. The evaluation shall include:

a)	identification and assessment of management documentation and a sufficient variety and number of records at each operational site selected for evaluation in order to confirm that management is functioning effectively and as described, particularly with respect to the identified critical control points;

b)	interviews with a sufficient variety and number of employees, their representatives, including worker’s organizations, employer’s representatives, and contractors, at each operational site selected for evaluation in order to verify the organization’s conformance to all applicable certification requirements. The interviewer shall ensure that comments can be provided in confidence;

c)	as a minimum, interviews shall be conducted to verify training measures and understanding of individual responsibilities at different locations across the operation under evaluation;

d)	review of the organization’s implementation of all applicable corrective action requests;

e)	review of all complaints, disputes, or allegations of nonconformities received by the organization and/or the certification body;

f)	physical inspection of all sites selected for evaluation, including inspection of all locations where operational activities under the scope of the certificate are carried out. Desk audits may be conducted where:

i.	the site does not take physical possession of FSC-certified materials or products, controlled material, or FSC controlled wood in their own or rented facilities, and does not label, alter, store, or repackage the products (e.g. sales office);

ii.	the site is used for storage of finished and labelled products only, and where the certification body has confirmed through an initial physical inspection that there is no risk of mixing FSC-certified products with other materials (e.g. the site only stores FSC-certified products). Certification bodies shall conduct physical inspection of these storage sites at least once during the five-year duration of a certificate;

iii.	the physical inspection during surveillance evaluations of one-time project certificates is not relevant (e.g. there is nothing to inspect on the site; a single delivery of materials to the project; when all project members supplying the project are FSC-certified).

NOTE: Certification bodies are not obliged to conduct desk audits, even when all requirements specified in Clause 2.6 f) above are satisfied. At its own discretion, initially or at any time, the certification body may decide to carry out site visits where and when necessary to ensure confidence in a certificate.

g)	purchasing and sales documentation of any materials or products related to FSC certification (e.g. invoices, bills, transport documents, sales contracts);

h)	confirmation that inputs described as FSC-certified or FSC Controlled Wood were covered by a valid FSC chain of custody certificate and supplied with the applicable FSC claims and certificate codes;

i)	review of systems for controlling FSC claims: 

i.	for percentage and credit systems, review of calculations of percentages and/or credits for each product group within the scope of the certificate;

ii.	for transfer systems, review of a sample of records of certified outputs, and confirmation that these can be traced to certified inputs

iii.	for project certification: verification that only eligible materials were used in projects (or components thereof) and the FSC claims made on them are true and correct;

j)	confirmation of the correct use of FSC trademarks (on-product and promotional) and the ‘FSC Controlled Wood’ claim in segregation marks, sales, and transport documentation;

k)	review of training records (e.g. training materials and list of participants);

2\.7	In situations where physical inspection of sites selected for evaluation is not possible or viable due to:

a)	demonstrated health and/or safety risk to auditors (demonstrated through verifiable public sources, e.g. official travel warnings or restrictions), or

b)	travel restrictions imposed by organizational (certificate holder/ certification body) health and safety policies or public authorities, or

c)	other demonstrated events of force majeure, the certification body may apply for a derogation to replace an on-site audit with a desk audit. Derogation applications will be evaluated on a case by case basis. The application shall include:

i.	certificate code of the company;

ii.	activities under the scope of the certificate (products and processes);

iii.	evidences of circumstances preventing the on-site audit (e.g. an official travel warning);

iv.	other additional information, as requested by FSC.

NOTE: In case of existing active derogations issued by FSC International for specific situations, this clause is not applicable.
## 3	Surveillance evaluations
3\.1	The certification body shall carry out a surveillance evaluation to monitor the organization’s continued conformance to all applicable certification requirements at least annually.

NOTE: The evaluation of corrective action to close major nonconformity may require on-site audits at shorter intervals.

3\.2	For a certificate that has a five-year validity, at least four surveillance evaluations shall take place before the certificate expires. The number of surveillance evaluations may be reduced if Clause 3.3 applies. 

NOTE: In the context of surveillance, “annually” is to be interpreted as follows: at least once per calendar year, but no later than 15 months after the last evaluation (determined by the date of the field visit or desk evaluation).

3\.3	For an operation or site that did not perform activities under the scope of the CoC certificate (e.g. did not produce, label, or sell any FSC-certified material and did not source controlled material or sell any FSC Controlled Wood since the previous audit), a surveillance evaluation may be waived. However, certification bodies shall not waive more than two consecutive surveillance evaluations. 

NOTE: The decision to waive a surveillance evaluation on the grounds described above is at the discretion of the certification body. The certification body may require a surveillance evaluation to be carried out if this is considered necessary to ensure confidence in the certificate. 

3\.4	When new or revised standards become effective, Clause 3.3 may be applied for surveillance evaluations, if the following requirements are met:

a)	the certification body shall conduct an assessment of the organization’s procedures against the relevant new standard requirements at the regular time scheduled for the surveillance audit. 

b)	The assessment shall be carried out on-site if:

i.	the organization’s chain of custody system requires adjustments due to the changed requirements that, if left unaddressed, are likely to result in major non-compliances; 

ii.	the organization will use a new system for controlling FSC claims under a specific product group (FSC-STD-40-004);

iii.	the certification body deems this necessary to evaluate the implementation of corrective action requests or a change of the certificate scope.

NOTE: The intent is to ensure that organizations are in full compliance with the new or revised standard at the time they again take up activities under the scope of their FSC chain of custody certificate.

c)	if an organization’s chain of custody certificate suspension extends beyond the scheduled time for their regular surveillance audit when a new or revised certification standard becomes effective, the certification body shall conduct an assessment of the organization’s procedures to ensure that they are in compliance with the relevant new standard requirements at the time when suspension is lifted.

3\.5	When a surveillance evaluation is waived, the certification body shall require the organization to sign a declaration stating that no material has been produced, labelled, or sold as FSC-certified; sourced as controlled material; or sold as FSC Controlled Wood since the last audit. The declaration shall contain a commitment by the organization to maintain the chain of custody system during the period in question and for personnel to contact the certification body as soon as they wish to produce, label, or sell material as FSC-certified, source controlled material, or sell FSC Controlled Wood. The certification body shall audit the organization no later than three months after the restart of the activities listed in this clause (e.g. restart of FSC production) to confirm the maintenance of the chain of custody system. 

3\.6	At the next surveillance evaluation, the certification body shall review all records back to the previous surveillance evaluation to ensure that the chain of custody system has been maintained and that no material has been produced, labelled, or sold as FSC-certified, sourced as controlled material, or sold as FSC Controlled Wood in accordance with the waive declaration required in Clause 3.5.

3\.7	In addition to the requirements specified in Clause 2.6, the certification body shall review and assess at minimum:

a)	any changes to the scope of the certificate, including new chain of custody operations or participating sites, in the Due Diligence System and changes in business activities;

b)	changes to the organization’s management system;

c)	FSC-certified production and inventory records.  
## 4	Certification decision 
4\.1	Certification bodies shall make certification decisions based on their evaluation of the chain of custody operation's conformity to each applicable requirement specified in the relevant FSC normative document(s) and in accordance with the latest version of FSC-STD-20-001.

4\.2	 The certification body shall record all identified nonconformities in the evaluation report or associated checklists.

4\.3	For group and multisite evaluations, the specification of nonconformities shall distinguish between central office level and participating-site level, where:

a)	nonconformities at the central office level may be caused by:

i.	failure to fulfil a central office responsibility, such as administration, internal inspection, record-keeping, trademark use, and others as required by the relevant FSC normative document(s);

ii.	failure to ensure that participating sites conform to a corrective action request issued by the certification body or the central office;

iii.	failure of sites to fulfil a responsibility, sufficient in number of sites, extent of the failure, and/or consequences, to demonstrate that central office control has broken down (e.g. where identical nonconformities identified by the certification body are issued to three or more participating sites during an evaluation, the corrective action request may be a result of ineffective training or support by the central office);

b)	nonconformities at the participating-site level may be caused by:

i.	failure to fulfil a responsibility, including but not limited to timely provision of adequate information, effective response to internal corrective actions, or correct trademark use;

ii.	failure to meet the applicable requirements of the relevant FSC normative documents.

4\.4	Five or more major corrective action requests issued to the central office of a group or multisite by the certification body shall result in the suspension of the entire certificate. Five or more major corrective action requests issued to a participating site of a group or multisite certificate by the certification body shall result in suspension of that particular participating site but will not necessarily result in the suspension of the entire certificate. Nonconformities identified at the participating-site level may result in nonconformities at the central office level when the nonconformities are determined to be the result of the central office’s performance, per Clause 4.3 a).

4\.5	For controlled wood evaluations, nonconformities may be caused by failure of the organization to conform to any of the applicable requirements, including but not limited to examples provided in Box 1 below.

NOTE: Supplier-level nonconformities with relevant requirements may result in a corrective action request to the organization.


![picture](Aspose.Words.007b2c2b-8a93-4a43-b6a9-bd329a586f02.001.png)

4\.6	A certificate shall be issued to the organization that has direct management responsibility for the chain of custody system under its control. 

NOTE: Certification bodies may issue a chain of custody certificate that covers more than one site, according to the eligibility criteria specified in FSC-STD-40-004.

4\.7	A chain of custody certificate with the sale of FSC Controlled Wood in its scope shall also include the FSC Controlled Wood certificate code issued by the certification body, in the form:  XXX-CW-###### – where XXX is the initials of the certification body and ###### is a unique, six-digit number issued by the certification body, which shall be the same as for the corresponding chain of custody certificate.

4\.8	A chain of custody certificate may be issued before the organization has taken physical possession of eligible inputs (FSC-certified, FSC Controlled Wood, controlled material, or reclaimed material) if the certification body is satisfied that an operational chain of custody system is in place. In such cases:

a)	the certification body shall require that the organization notifies it as soon as eligible input stock is available or the production of FSC-certified material has started;

b)	the certification body shall carry out a (second) site visit or conduct the first surveillance evaluation within three months following the receipt of such a notification, unless the main evaluation has not resulted in any nonconformity related to the management of critical control points.
# PART II: Evaluating Organizations against Specific Requirements
## 5	Evaluation of project certificates
5\.1	For one-time project certification, the certification body shall conduct a main evaluation, annual surveillance evaluations and final evaluation when the project is finalized. Although the project may be eligible for desk audits according to Clause 2.6 f) iii), at least one physical audit by the certification body is required before a project statement is issued by the organization to the project. Non-FSC certified project members shall be sampled by using the following formula:

y = 0.8 * square root(x), where:

y = minimum number of non-FSC-certified project members to be audited by the certification body (rounded to the upper whole number)

x = total number of non-FSC-certified project members (ongoing and the ones that have been finalized in the period since the last evaluation) 

NOTE: The concept of outsourcing does not apply to project certification, since contractors under the scope of the certificate classify as project members. 

5\.2	For continuous project certification, the certification body shall conduct a main evaluation, annual surveillance evaluations and re-evaluations. At each evaluation, the certification body shall audit a sample of the participating sites, project sites included in the scope of the certificate to verify their conformance with the applicable FSC normative documents, according to the following criteria:

a)	Participating sites of Group and Multi-site certificates: the certification body shall sample the participating sites for evaluation according to Clause 7.5 of this standard. The participating sites that apply FSC-STD-40-004 and FSC-STD-40-006 shall be sampled separately by the certification body.

b)	Project sites: They shall be sampled by using the following formula:

y = 0.8 * square root(x), where:

y = minimum number of project sites to be audited by the certification body (rounded to the upper whole number)

x = total number of project sites (ongoing and the ones that have been finalized in the period since the last evaluation)

5\.3	The certification body shall select specific projects to achieve the required sample number for evaluation. In the selection process, the certification body shall include randomly selected projects and shall ensure that the overall sample selected is representative of the certificate scope under evaluation and covers the widest possible range in terms of:

a)	geographic distribution;

b)	types of projects;

c)	size of projects;

d)	other criteria, as deemed relevant by the certification body.

5\.4	The certification body shall avoid visiting the same project sites in consecutive audits, unless there are clear and justified reasons for doing so (e.g. this is deemed necessary for the evaluation of corrective action requests or complaints received about the organization).

5\.5	When evaluating the materials that have been used in projects, certification bodies may also accept materials that have been purchased by the organization before the main evaluation, provided that the organization is able to provide evidences that materials have been sourced with FSC claims from valid FSC-certified suppliers. The retroactive certification of projects that have been already finalized is not possible.
## 6	Evaluation of controlled wood according to FSC-STD-40-005 
**Stakeholder consultation**

NOTE: Stakeholder consultation requirements apply only for the first evaluation and subsequent re-evaluations of the organization to FSC-STD-40-005. However, these are applicable only where material is sourced from unassessed, or specified risk, areas according to the applicable FSC risk assessment.  

6\.1	The certification body shall conduct stakeholder consultations adequate to the size and scale of the organization’s due diligence system (DDS) to verify its conformance to applicable requirements. The certification body shall:

a)	identify and invite directly affected stakeholders to participate in the consultation. Invitation of relevant FSC network partners is mandatory; 

b)	provide a public notification about the consultation process, including dates and activities in the scope of the consultation, in order to accommodate participation of interested stakeholders. Means of notification shall ensure that interested stakeholders can access information about the consultation;

NOTE 1: Invitation of directly affected stakeholders aims to ensure they are directly informed about the consultation process and to increase their engagement, whilst public notification aims to provide additional opportunity for engagement of interested stakeholders. 

NOTE 2: Consultation can only be conducted based on voluntary engagement of directly affected or interested stakeholders.

c)	provide participating stakeholders with access to information as required in Section 6 of FSC-STD-40-005 at least six weeks prior to the evaluation; 

d)	employ effective and culturally appropriate means of invitation, notification, and consultation; 

NOTE: Examples of techniques may include announcement via the certification body's website; face-to-face meetings; personal contacts by phone, email, or letter; notice published in the national and/or local press and on relevant websites; local radio announcements; announcements on local customary notice boards. Consultation may include a request for written comments on a predetermined set of specific questions.

e)	ask participating stakeholders for consent for the publication of their comments; 

f)	provide stakeholders with the opportunity to comment in confidence;

g)	evaluate information and comments provided by stakeholders objectively and meaningfully. The certification decision shall only be affected in so far as the comments provide evidence of conformity or nonconformity to the applicable requirements;

h)	respond to all stakeholders who participated in the consultation process and explain how their comments were taken into account within 30 days of making the certification decision; 

i)	maintain records of the consultation process, including stakeholders identified, stakeholders who participated in the consultation and their comments, and evidence that the consultation was carried out in line with the requirements of this standard.

Evaluation of the organization’s due diligence system

General requirements

6\.2	The certification body shall design and implement a system for evaluating the relevance, effectiveness, and adequacy of the DDS, according to the scope and scale of the organization's operation. The certification body shall specify and justify in its system the means of verification of risk assessments and control measures established by the organization, including, but not limited to:

a)	a mechanism for verifying risk designations against available sources of information and applicable requirements;

b)	field verification  with a scope and sampling pool relevant for the DDS under evaluation. The sampling pool shall be sufficient to confirm mitigation of risk related to origin and risk of mixing of material with non-eligible inputs;

c)	corroborating evidence provided by the organization with independent sources when possible.

NOTE: Specific requirements for evaluating adequacy of control measures are included in Clause 6.18.

6\.3	The certification body shall evaluate whether the DDS has been implemented as designed and in accordance with all applicable requirements and any additional guidance provided or approved by the FSC Performance and Standards Unit. 

6\.4	All records used for evaluating the DDS shall be sampled at random. When selecting documents for sampling, the certification body shall not be guided or influenced by staff of the organization.

6\.5	The certification body shall verify whether information on material and supply chains allows the organization to:

a)	confirm the origin of the material; 

b)	conduct a robust risk assessment related to the origin of the material; 

c)	conduct a robust risk assessment related to mixing material with non-eligible inputs in supply chains;

d)	develop and implement adequate control measures;

e)	review and, if necessary, revise the DDS to ensure its relevance, effectiveness, or adequacy.

NOTE: This includes verification of whether the organization has enforced its suppliers to notify it of any changes affecting risk designation or mitigation.

6\.6	The certification body shall not accept information or documentation that only consists of a declaration of conformity by the organization and/or suppliers as evidence of the organization’s conformity to the applicable requirements.

6\.7	The certification body shall evaluate the justification for excluding confidential information provided by the organization (see Clause 6.2 (d) in FSC-STD-40-005) in a restrictive way, taking into account business sensitivity of the information, applicable legislation, and the public interest served by disclosure.

**Evaluation of risk assessments**

Risk assessment related to origin

6\.8	The certification body shall verify the correct use of applicable FSC risk assessments. 

6\.9	The certification body may extend the period during which the organization shall adapt the DDS to approved risk assessments for a single exceptional extension of up to two months when justified by circumstances beyond the control of the organization. The certification body shall record such circumstances. 

NOTE: Justifiable circumstances for an extension exclude problems in planning or scheduling activities in the scope of the DDS.

6\.10	The certification body shall verify whether the organization's risk assessment and risk designations are adequate and justified, including whether:

i.	the risk assessment follows all applicable requirements;

ii.	the sources of information used are independent, objective, and sufficient to justify risk designation;

iii.	the geographic scale of the assessment is adequate to the supply area(s);

iv.	the risk designation is justified and verifiable based on sources used in the risk assessment;

v.	the risk specification includes sufficient information to allow the development of adequate control measures; 

vi.	consultations with experts have been conducted as required;

vii.	experts used to conduct the risk assessment meet the qualification requirements in Annex C of FSC-STD-40-005;

viii.	joint risk assessments are managed as required;

ix.	the risk designation is justified with evidence by using independent and objective sources of information.

6\.11	The certification body shall verify whether the organization has reviewed the continued correctness and relevance of its risk assessment and made revisions where necessary.

NOTE: This includes reviewing the risk assessment when using material originating from FSC-certified management units located in low risk areas that lose their certified status due to suspension (according to Annex A, Clauses 1.5.3 and 1.5.4, in FSC-STD-40-005).

6\.12	The certification body shall approve a risk assessment conducted by the organization for its existing supply area, and/or extended to new supply areas, if the risk assessment process and risk designation meet the applicable requirements.

6\.13	The certification body shall notify the FSC Supply Chain Integrity Program (fiber-testing@fsc.org) regarding participation of the organization in the FSC Fibre Testing Program, where applicable.

6\.14	If the certification body confirms that the results of an organization’s risk assessment contradict the results of another organization’s risk assessment for the same area, the risk assessment that has been conducted with a higher level of scrutiny, accuracy, and/or precaution shall prevail.  

NOTE: It is strongly recommended to consult published risk assessments on the FSC database in order to identify potential conflicts related to different risk designations.

6\.15	If the certification body receives comments or complaints about a risk assessment, the certification body shall forward them to the responsible body.

NOTE: If comments are related to a national risk assessment (NRA), they should be sent to the responsible body indicated in the NRA. If they are related to a centralized national risk assessment (CNRA), comments should be sent directly to FSC.

Risk assessment related to mixing material

6\.16	The certification body shall verify whether the risk assessment related to the mixing of material with non-eligible inputs during transport, processing, and storage before the material reaches the organization is adequate to the scope of the DDS and justified.

Evaluation of risk mitigation

6\.17	The certification body shall verify the implementation of control measures, including:

a)	minimum requirements according to Clauses 4.10 and 4.11 of FSC-STD-40-005;

b)	mandatory control measures provided in the applicable national risk assessment;

c)	whether applicable approved controlled wood documents listed in FSC-PRO-60-002b EN List of FSC Approved Controlled Wood Documents were used;

d)	whether the organization used the opinion of at least one expert to justify the adequacy of control measures for controlled wood categories 2 and 3;

e)	whether the organization has conducted stakeholder consultation according to the requirements of FSC-STD-40-005 (Annex B) for the following situations (where applicable):

i.	unspecified risk designated for controlled wood categories 2 and 3; 

ii.	consultation conducted as control measure for other risks; 

iii.	consultation conducted to verify adequacy of control measures;

f)	control measures at the level of the supplier(s).

6\.18	The certification body shall verify the adequacy of control measures, including:

a)	a sample of each type of control measure for each type of risk identified in the DDS. The sampling rate shall be established and justified by the certification body according to the scope of the DDS;

NOTE: Some examples of this type of verification include the following: if the organization has established field verification at the level of the supply unit as a control measure, this will require, at minimum, a field verification of a sample of supply units by the certification body (audits at the forest level); if the organization has established a stakeholder consultation as a control measure, this will require, at minimum, a verification of sample records from the consultation.

b)	comparison with examples of control measures provided in Annex E in FSC-STD-40-005 in terms of rigorousness;

c)	results of internal and external audits by the organization;

d)	comments from stakeholder consultation; 

e)	comments, complaints, and appeals received by the certification body;

f)	the process of review and revision of the DDS by the organization. 

6\.19	If the organization has replaced mandatory control measures provided in applicable national risk assessments, the certification body shall:

a) 	evaluate the alternative control measures to determine adequacy and, if conditions specified in FSC-STD-40-005 (Clause 4.13) are met, approve the control measures;

b) 	verify whether the organization has forwarded a description of the alternative control measures to the body responsible for maintenance of the national risk assessment.

6\.20	If the organization has identified that legal requirements may be in conflict with adequate control measures, the certification body shall evaluate control measures established by the organization, and, if control measures allow risk mitigation, approve such control measures before they are implemented.

NOTE: Conflicts only occur where a legal obligation prevents the implementation of control measures. It is not considered a conflict if control measures exceed the minimum requirements for legal compliance.

6\.21	If the certification body determines that the control measures of one organization contradict the control measures of another organization for the same type of risk in the same area, the control measures that are more robust and effective shall prevail in the evaluation of the adequacy of control measures.
## 7	Evaluation of group and multisite chain of custody certificates 
7\.1	At each evaluation, the certification body shall evaluate the ability of the central office to manage the number of participating sites of the certificate and approve an annual growth rate up to a limit of 100% based on the number of participating sites at the time of the evaluation. Where a certificate has 20 or fewer participating sites at the time of the main evaluation, the certification body may approve a growth rate higher than 100%, based on the demonstrated capacity of the central office to manage a higher number of participating sites.

7\.2	If the central office wants to increase the number of participating sites in the certificate scope beyond the approved annual growth rate, the certification body shall audit the central office and a sample of the new sites according to Clause 7.5 b) before the growth resumes.

7\.3	In the audit for inclusion of new participating sites, the certification body shall establish a new growth limit for the period between the expansion-of-scope audit and the next evaluation by the certification body.

7\.4	New participating sites added to the certificate scope shall only be considered certified after the certification body has added the new sites to the FSC database of registered certificates. Certification bodies shall enter new sites into the database within one week of the date of receipt of the central office’s audit report.

NOTE: Certification bodies are not required to revise and approve the central office’s audit reports.

7\.5	The certification body shall select a sample of the participating sites for evaluation of conformance to the applicable FSC normative documents. The certification body shall divide the participating sites into two sets of sites: normal-risk participating sites and high-risk participating sites (see Terms and definitions), which shall be sampled separately by using the following formulas:

a)	for main evaluations, surveillance evaluations, and re-evaluations:

y = R * square root(x), where:

y = number of participating sites to be audited by the certification body (rounded to the upper whole number)

R = risk index (see Table A)

x = total number of normal-risk or high-risk participating sites

NOTE: In the case of surveillance evaluations, participating sites which have not had any FSC activity according to Clause 3.3 since the previous certification body evaluation do not need to be included in the population of sites (value ‘x’ in the formula) from which the sample is drawn.

b)	for the inclusion of new participating sites (beyond the approved annual growth rate):

y = R * square root(n), where:

y = number of participating sites to be audited by the certification body (rounded to the upper whole number)

R = risk index (see Table A)

n = number of new normal-risk or high-risk participating sites to be added to the certificate scope

7\.6	Sites that have been incorporated into the certificate scope in the period between the certification body’s evaluations shall be sampled together with the sites that were already in the scope during the previous evaluation.

**Table A. Matrix for determination of R (risk index)** 

NOTE: R (risk index) is obtained by summing-up the scores given to the group or multisite certificate under evaluation.

</table>

7\.7	If new participating sites are being added to the scope of a multisite or group certificate at the time of a surveillance evaluation or re-evaluation, they shall be considered as an independent set for the determination of the sample size, to be sampled according to the requirements detailed in Clause 7.5 b). After inclusion of new participating sites in the certificate scope, the new participating sites shall be added to the existing ones to determine the sample size for future surveillance evaluations or re-evaluations.

7\.8	The certification body shall select specific participating sites to achieve the required sample number for evaluation. In the selection process, the certification body shall include randomly selected sites and shall ensure that the overall sample selected is representative of the multisite or group under evaluation and covers the widest possible range in terms of:

a)	geographic distribution;

b)	activities and/or products produced;

c)	size of participating sites (size may be determined by the number of employees, production volumes, and/or annual turnover of forest product sales);

d)	other criteria, as deemed relevant by the certification body.

7\.9	The certification body shall avoid visiting the same participating sites in consecutive audits, unless there are clear and justified reasons for doing so (e.g. this is deemed necessary for the evaluation of corrective action requests or complaints received about the organization).

7\.10	The central office shall be audited by the certification body in each evaluation in addition to the selected participating sites. 

NOTE: In exceptional cases, the central office’s representative may take all of the relevant required documentation, reports, records, and manuals to a location other than the organization’s office for review by the auditor, provided that this does not affect the quality of the assessment of this material and the organization’s chain of custody control systems.

7\.11	For surveillance evaluations of group and multisite certificates, the certification body shall review and assess:

a)	the list of participating sites;

b)	the rate of change of participating sites (new sites, sites that have left the certificate);

c)	the capacity of the central office’s management system to manage any change in scope of the certificate including any increase in size, number, or complexity of operational sites within the scope of the certificate;

d)	formal communication and written documents sent to participating sites by the organization since the previous certification-body surveillance;

e)	records of the central office’s audits;

f)	records of any corrective action requests issued by the central office, including follow-up and close-out evidence;

NOTE: Documentation and records covering the period since the previous evaluation may be submitted to the certification body for review prior to a site visit.
## 8	Evaluation of supplier audit programs for reclaimed materials
8\.1	For organizations or participating sites that have a supplier audit program, the certification body shall carry out annual on-site verification audits of the supplier sites, unless the organization’s supplier audits were carried out by another FSC-accredited certification body. The certification body shall select for evaluation as a minimum (y) 0.8 times the square root (y=0.8 Öx) rounded to the upper whole number, where ‘x’ is the number of suppliers audited by the participating site in the current evaluation period (according to Clause 4.1 of FSC-STD-40-007 V2-0).

NOTE 1: For group and multisite certificates, the calculation of the supplier audit sample shall be conducted at the participating-site level.

NOTE 2: Certification bodies are not required to audit the same sites audited by the participating sites in the current evaluation period.


## 9	Evaluation of contractors operating under outsourcing agreements
9\.1	The certification body shall monitor the chain of custody system applied throughout outsourcing arrangements to ensure conformance to all applicable requirements of the FSC normative documents. The certification body shall confirm that the risks associated with mixing, substitution, or false claims by the organization or the contractor are controlled.

9\.2	The certification body shall conduct a risk assessment of the chain of custody control system used during outsourcing activities performed off-site from the certified organization or participating site. An outsourcing arrangement with a certified or non-certified contractor shall be classified as ‘high risk’ if any of the following applies:

a)	the organization outsources all or most of the manufacturing processes of a product; or

b)	a contractor mixes different input materials (e.g. FSC 100%, controlled material, FSC Controlled Wood); or

c)	a contractor applies the FSC label to the product; or

d)	a contractor does not physically return the FSC-certified product to the contracting organization after outsourcing; or

e)	activities are outsourced to an organization in another country with a Transparency International Corruption Perception Index (CPI) lower than 50.

NOTE: Even in cases that are not considered ‘high risk’ as per the indicators above, the certification body may require on-site audits at a contractor’s facility if any risk of improper additions or mixing by the contractor is identified.

9\.3	Even when one or more of the above high-risk indicators apply to the outsourced activity, the certification body may approve the low-risk categorization if a low risk of contamination can be demonstrated due to one of the following factors:

a)	the product is permanently labelled or marked in a way that the contractor cannot alter or exchange products (e.g. heat brand, printed materials); or

b)	the product is palletized or otherwise maintained as a secure unit that is not broken apart during outsourcing; or

c)	the contractor is employed for services that do not involve manufacture or transformation of certified products (e.g. warehousing, storage, distribution, logistics); or

d)	 the contractor is an FSC-certified organization that includes documented procedures for outsourcing services within the scope of its certificate.

9\.4	For high-risk situations, the certification body shall undertake a physical inspection of a sample of contractors to be included in outsourced processes or activities in the scope of the organization’s chain of custody certificate, according to the sampling criteria specified in Clause 9.6, as part of its evaluation (main evaluation, surveillance evaluation, and re-evaluation). In the case of multisite or group certificates, the selection of contractors shall be coordinated with the selection of the participating sites which have been sampled for evaluation of conformance to the FSC chain of custody standards. 

NOTE: For group and multisite certificates, the calculation of the contractor sample shall be conducted at the participating-site level.

9\.5	If the organization wants to include new high-risk contractors in its certificate scope in the period between the certification body evaluations, the certification body shall conduct an expansion-of-scope evaluation and conduct a physical inspection of a sample of the new contractors according to the sampling criteria specified in Clause 9.6 below.

9\.6	The sampling number (y) shall be at minimum the square root of the number of high-risk contractors (x), rounded to the next whole number: y=square root(x).

NOTE: Contractors that hold their own FSC chain of custody certificate for the outsourced process and contractors that did not provide outsourcing services to the organization since the last certification body’s evaluation do not need to be evaluated by the contracting party's certification body and therefore do not need to be added to the number of contractors (x) in the formula above.

9\.7	The certification body shall evaluate records of material inputs, outputs, and transport documentation associated with material used in the manufacture of FSC-certified products during outsourcing. 
## 10	Transaction verification
10\.1	The certification body shall cooperate and support ASI’s transaction verification activities by collecting, analyzing, and sharing relevant information related to FSC transactions in a timely manner (i.e. by providing a response as soon as possible).

10\.2	In order to support the monitoring and control of false claims in the system, the certification body shall register the following information in the FSC database of certificates (as non-public information):

a)	organizations that reported no FSC sales since the previous evaluation;

b)	non-conformities, suspensions, terminations, and removal of participating sites due to false claims made by organizations;

c)	recommendation of organizations that should be investigated by ASI and the justification (e.g. evidence suggests that records are being hidden from the certification body, complaints received about the organization, potential volume mismatches between the organization and its trading partners).
## 11	Evaluation of FSC core labour requirements
11\.1	The certification body shall verify that the organization has adopted  and implemented a policy statement, or statements, that encompass the FSC core labour requirements.

11\.2	The certification body shall verify that the policy statements are made available to stakeholders.  

11\.3	The certification body shall design and implement a system for evaluating the relevance, effectiveness, and adequacy of the organization’s self-assessment and conformity to Section 7 of FSC-STD-40-004, according to the scope, scale, intensity and risk of the organization's operation. The certification body shall specify, justify and document in its system the means of verification of the self-assessments, including, but not limited to:

a)	a mechanism for verifying self-assessments against available sources of information and applicable requirements;

b)	identifying the legal requirements related to the FSC core labour Requirements and applicable to the organization/site.

c)	corroborating evidence provided by the organization with independent sources when possible. (e.g. documentation, interviews etc.) as required according to Section 2.6 ‘Evaluation at the level of the operational site’. 

d)	determining the frequency and sampling requirements of future audits within the certification cycle for each organization based on the results of the previous audit related to the FSC core labour requirements and the self-assessment. 

e)	including auditors with specific competencies if needed.
