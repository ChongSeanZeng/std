NOTE: Group COC certificates are evaluated by the certification body based on a defined sampling methodology as specified in FSC-STD-20-011.



# PART II Specific requirements for Multi-site and Group COC certification 
## 4	Administrative requirements
4\.1	The Multi-site or Group COC certificate shall be administered by a Central Office, which shall be, or act on behalf of, The Organization holding the certificate. 

4\.2	The Central Office shall be responsible for ensuring that all applicable certification requirements are met by all Participating Sites under the scope of the certificate. The Central Office shall demonstrate its management system’s capacity, as well as technical and human resources, to manage continuously and effectively the number of Participating Sites under the scope of the certificate.

4\.3	Where the Participating Sites are not linked through common ownership, a 'consent form' or a contract shall be signed by each Participating Site. This document shall include the following:

a)	Acknowledgement and agreement to the general obligations and responsibilities for participation in the Multi-site or Group COC certificate, as stipulated in this standard, the certification contract, and the documented procedures of the Central Office;

b)	Agreement to conform to all applicable FSC certification requirements and the documented contractual obligations, corrective action requests, and procedures of the Central Office;

c)	Authorization of the Central Office to apply for and administer the FSC Chain of Custody certification on behalf of the Participating Site;

d)	Acknowledgement of mutual responsibility for the maintenance of the certificate, where nonconformities identified at the level of the Participating Sites or the Central Office may result in corrective action requests, certificate suspension, and/or certificate withdrawal.

NOTE: Five (5) or more Major Corrective Action Requests (CARs) issued to the Central Office by the certification body will result in suspension of the entire certificate. Five or more Major CARs issued to a Participating Site by the certification body will result in suspension of that particular Participating Site, but it will not necessarily result in the suspension of the entire certificate. Nonconformities identified at the level of a Participating Site level may result in nonconformities at the Central Office when the nonconformities are determined to be the result of the Central Office’s performance (e.g. where identical CARs are issued to several Participating Sites, the CAR may be a result of ineffective training or support by the Central Office).

4\.4	An Organization may hold a certificate for less than 100% of their associated sites. It is also acceptable that a Central Office holds more than one certificate. In both cases, clear procedures shall exist for ensuring that only the Participating Sites (sites included in the respective FSC certificate) claim their products as FSC certified and use the FSC trademarks.

4\.5	All Participating Sites shall be subject to the Central Office Audit Program, unless the certification body is auditing all Participating Sites (100% audit sampling) during each evaluation (main evaluation, surveillance evaluation, re-evaluation).

NOTE: The certification body conducts an initial assessment and annual surveillance audits of the Central Office as well as of a sample of the Participating Sites. The Central Office is exempt from implementing an annual Audit Program if the certification body conducts annual audits of all Participating Sites (100% audit sampling). However, an annual surveillance audit of the Central Office by the certification body will always be conducted.

4\.6	A Participating Site can also act as the Central Office. In this case, this Participating Site is not required to be included in the Central Office Audit Program, but it shall be annually audited by the certification body for verification of conformance to all applicable certification requirements.
## 5	Requirements for the Central Office
5\.1	Quality management

5\.5.2	The Central Office may add new Participating Sites to the certificate scope at any time within the annual growth limit approved by its certification body.

NOTE: At each evaluation, the certification body will evaluate the ability of the Central Office to manage the number of Participating Sites in the certificate and approve an annual growth rate up to a limit of 100% based on the number of Participating Sites at the time of the evaluation. Where a certificate has 20 (twenty) or fewer Participating Sites at the time of the main evaluation, the certification body may approve a growth rate higher than 100%, based on the demonstrated capacity of the Central Office to manage a higher number of Participating Sites.

5\.5.3	If the number of Participating Sites is going to exceed the approved growth limit, new sites can only be added to the certificate after the certification body has done an audit of the Central Office and a sample of the new sites.

Participating Sites shall re-consider their eligibility for Group certification twelve (12) months after the beginning of the transitional status.
