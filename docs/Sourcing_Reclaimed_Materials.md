## Terms and definitions
**FSC Recycled**: FSC-certified reclaimed material based on exclusive input from reclaimed sources, and supplied with a percentage claim or credit claim. FSC Recycled material or products are eligible to be used in FSC Mixed or FSC Recycled product groups. 

**Official reclaimed paper classification and assortment system:** Official classification and assortment systems of reclaimed papers are developed by (supra-)national organizations (e.g. state, industry associations) and are based upon defined, verifiable and transparent criteria, offering a benchmark for dispute resolution mechanism. These criteria usually aim at the categorisation of reclaimed paper material according to certain quality aspects, but their application in specific supply chains should allow the characterization of the relevant points of reclamation. Official classification and assortment systems are recognized and used in the market in such a way that the classifications and corresponding claims are basic elements in commercial transaction documents and incorrect claims may lead to legal actions against the one who made the claim. 

**Point of Reclamation:** The location, process or site where material is diverted from the waste stream from industrial, residential or municipal sources and reclaimed thereby constituting the starting point within the supply chain for reclaimed material.

**Post-consumer reclaimed material**: Material that is reclaimed from a consumer or commercial product that has been used for its intended purpose by individuals, households or by commercial, industrial and institutional facilities in their role as end-users of the product. 

**Pre-consumer reclaimed material:** Material that is reclaimed from a process of secondary manufacture or further downstream industry, in which the material has not been intentionally produced, is unfit for end use and not capable of being re-used on-site in the same manufacturing process that generated it.

**Reclaimed material**: Material that demonstrably would have otherwise been disposed of as waste or used for energy recovery, but has instead been collected and reclaimed as input material, in lieu of virgin material, for re-use, recycling, re-milling in a manufacturing process or other commercial application. Inputs of the following material categories are classified as reclaimed material: 

a)	FSC Recycled material;

b)	Post-consumer reclaimed material;

c)	Pre-consumer reclaimed material.

## 1	Purchase of reclaimed forest-based materials
1\.1 The organization that purchases reclaimed forest-based materials (including materials such as bamboo and cork)  without FSC claims shall demonstrate that its reclaimed inputs for use in FSC Product Groups or FSC Projects comply with FSC definitions for pre-consumer and/or post-consumer reclaimed material (see Section D “Terms and Definitions”).

NOTE: In order to support the correct implementation of this standard, examples of pre-consumer and post-consumer wood and paper according to FSC definitions are provided in Annex I and II.
## 2	Suppliers validation and monitoring
2\.1 The organization shall conduct a validation process for its suppliers of reclaimed materials to determine whether the materials supplied are eligible to enter into FSC product groups, constituted by the following elements:

a) For each supplier, the organization shall maintain records and define the necessary documentation evidence and actions to demonstrate that materials supplied from them comply with FSC definitions for pre-consumer and post-consumer reclaimed material, including:

•	the name and address of the supplier;

•	supplier activity (e.g. purchaser/ collector from point of reclamation, trader); 

•	the reclaimed material categories to be supplied;

•	the level of control required (e.g. visual inspection upon receipt, supplier audits).

b) The organization shall monitor the conformance of suppliers in relation to the FSC definitions and purchase specifications and have a contingency plan to cater for non-conforming material or supply documentation.  (e.g. request correction of purchasing documents, temporary or permanent invalidation of the supplier, classify the material as non-eligible input for FSC products).
## 3	Material inspection and classification upon receipt
3\.1 Upon receipt, all reclaimed materials shall be verified through visual inspection and classified into pre-consumer and/or post-consumer reclaimed material. 

3\.2 The organization shall retain objective evidence for each supply confirming that the reclaimed materials comply with FSC definitions for pre-consumer and post-consumer.

NOTE: Different types of evidence can be retained for the control by the certification body, such as use of Official Reclaimed Paper Classification and Assortment Systems, material samples, pictures, quality analysis report, invoices, delivery notes or shipping documents, etc.

3\.3 In cases where the classification of reclaimed materials as pre-consumer and/or post-consumer cannot be demonstrated through objective evidence upon receipt, the organization shall include the supplier in a “Supplier Audit Program” as described in Clause 4 below.

3\.4 In case that the material received does not comply with purchase specifications and/or the quantities informed in the invoices are not correct, the organization shall carry out immediate follow-up actions to correct the deviation, as required in Clause 2.1 b) above. The actions shall be recorded and communicated to the organization’s certification body during the annual audits.

3\.5 In cases where the material received contains a mix of pre-consumer and post-consumer reclaimed material in its composition, the organization shall apply one of the following measures:

a)	Classify the full amount of material as pre-consumer reclaimed, or

b)	Analyse and confirm the quantities of pre-consumer and post-consumer material in the mix received. In this case, the supplier shall:

\- declare in writing the quantities of pre-consumer and post-consumer reclaimed material in each material mix supplied, and

\- be included in the “Supplier Audit Program”.
## 4	Supplier Audit Program
4\.1 The organization shall perform regular (at least annual) on-site audits of the suppliers included in the Supplier Audit Program (including overseas suppliers) based on a sampling approach. The minimum number of suppliers to be audited per year is as follows: the size of the sample shall be the square root’s number of suppliers (x) with 0.8 as a coefficient (y= 0.8 square root(x), where ‘y’ is the number of suppliers to be audited), rounded to the upper whole number. The organization shall ensure that the selected sample is alternating and representative in terms of their:

a) Geographic distribution;

b) Activities and/or products;

c) Size and/or annual production.

NOTE: Traders or sales offices that do not take physical possession of reclaimed materials, and will not alter, store or re-package the reclaimed materials may be verified through desk audits (remote audits).

4\.2 The organization may contract an accredited certification body or other external qualified party to carry out the supplier audits.

4\.3 In cases where the supplier selected for sampling sells reclaimed materials that were previously collected, classified and traded by other companies or sites, the complete supply chain of these materials shall be audited back to the point where the classification as pre-consumer and/or post consumer can be demonstrated through objective evidences.

4\.4 The organization shall evaluate and verify the documents and other evidence regarding the supplied material quantity, quality and compliance with FSC definitions of pre-consumer and post-consumer material, which includes: 

a) Supplier’s instructions or procedures in place to control and classify the reclaimed materials;

b) When applicable, trainings or instructions provided to the supplier’s personnel in relation to classification and control of reclaimed materials;

c) Registers that demonstrates the origin of the materials (e.g. pictures, address of the demolished house, invoices, etc).

NOTE: A declaration from the supplier, even if part of the contractual agreement, is not considered sufficient proof of the origin and material category. However, it can be used as additional evidence to demonstrate the material compliance with FSC definitions. 

4\.5 The organization shall document the supplier audits, including a record of the audit date, the audit findings in relation to the requirements in Clause 4.4, the names and qualifications of the auditors and examples of any evidence collected to verify the classification of the materials.
